1) Introduction: which we can populate partially from the paperâ€™s 
introduction or abstract

2) Data preparation: loading packages, etc.

3) Naive method - equal distribution: this is where we run the first part of
the code, merging the ACS mode share and calculating distances, etc.

4)Weighted method - distance and travel time redistribution: this is where we get
into calculating the weighted distribution by each mode; each mode should probably
have its own sub-section

5) Validation: check aggregate values and create maps (e.g., Figure 2 in the
paper)

6) Basic characteristics of estimated flows by mode: create histograms and Kepler
maps
