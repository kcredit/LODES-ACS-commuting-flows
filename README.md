# LODES-ACS-commuting-flows
This repository contains code for developing an open source method to derive small area estimates of linked (origin-destination) commuting trips by mode from open source Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Origin-Destination Statistics (known as LODES) and American Community Survey (ACS) data in R. This method is fully-customisable and can be applied at the block scale to the entire US (with a small number of exceptions) for every year from 2002-2019. For demonstration purposes, the code here applies this method to 2015 commuting flows at the tract scale in Cook County, Illinois. Although the data used in this application can be downloaded openly from the US Census Bureau (2015 LODES: https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/; 2013-2017 5-year ACS: https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), lightly-cleaned version are provided in this repository for convenience.
